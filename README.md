An Analysis of Shots and Goals from NHL Game Data

This project was completed as the capstone for the University of Calgary course DATA601 - Working with Data and Visualization. Our team is made up of:

- Alec Lunn
- Dylan Medina
- Matthew Zirpoli

## Introduction
As students in a Canadian city, we are avid fans of hockey. As data science students, what better way to use our new skills than to dive into data from our favorite sport? In this project, we use data from [NHL Game Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martinellis/nhl-game-data/data) on Kaggle. The main goal of our project was to explore data about shots and goals, and elicit key insights about them. Specifically, we sought to answer the following guiding questions about our data:

1. Where on the ice do shots have the best percentage of scoring goals/Where are you most likely to score a goal? What types of shots are most likely to score?

2. How does the score differential affect the team's decision-making and strategy during the game?

3. What are the key differences in all-star calibre shooting versus league average shooting?

4. Have shot patterns changed over the years (ie do they succeed from different areas, do players favour different shot types/locations)?
